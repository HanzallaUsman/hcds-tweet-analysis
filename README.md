# Human-centered data science project

## Project Name 
Sentiment Analysis on Cryptocurrency Values

## Project Description 

Cryptocurrencies are the trending digital assets which work as a medium of exchange through a computer network that is not reliant on any central authority. They derive their value from other sources such as supply and demand, cost of production, availability in exchanges, competition, governance and so on. Because it is also not regulated by a central authority, it is highly volatile and it is highly probable that the prices could have been affected by human-centered factors such as users’ sentiments. In this research, we aim to investigate to what extent human sentiment affects the cryptocurrency prices by analyzing a large amount of twitter data and the reach the data has (number of followers). 

Cryptocurrency is a growing field that we all look forward to seeing how it’s going to affect the concept of trading in the future. It has a potential to enable us for cheaper and faster transactions with decentralized systems, however, this may not be a perfect solution if its value is largely dependent on user sentiments. If cryptocurrencies are to become a common mode of payment in the future, we have to explore its volatility. The primary aim of this research is to investigate the volatility in crypto because of human sentiments. This research is therefore important to anyone who wishes to invest in it or who is interested to perform any trading activities using any cryptocurrency. 

From our research we hope to gain a better understanding of the volatility of cryptocurrencies in order to help us as well as the crypto community to take safe trading actions. We aim to potentially gain insights about the whole field and obtain a better understanding on how human sentiment can affect cryptocurrency prices. As potential future cryptocurrency users, we wish to understand this nature of cryptocurrency to protect us and the community from its potential harm. 

## Research Question

What is the impact of user sentiment on Cryptocurrency prices? If the prices are dependent on the user sentiment, then which one - positive or negative sentiment -  affects the price more?   

## Data used

Bitcoin tweets: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kaushiksuresh147/bitcoin-tweets

Dogecoin tweets: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vrajpatel337/dogecoin-tweets-250k

## Findings

## Limitations
1. Sentiment scores range from -1 to 1. But we never get daily average sentiment scores below 0. This could be because most people just create fake accounts to make positive tweets about the cryptocurrency they have investment in. We found a lot of user accounts which were created just weeks before making a tweet. Data filtering is a complex step that we could have looked into as a lot of decisions have to be made about which data to keep and which not to. So we decided to leave it as a future improvement.
2. Our results rely heavily on an already existing tweets dataset. We do have some days where tweets related to cryptocurrency were not made in the dataset. This shows that the dataset we have is in no way a complete data set from twitter containing all the related tweets on cryptocurrency. Relying on only one data set is one of the major limitations of this project. We could not get rid of this limitation, as we could not find the relevant data set we required and twitter api has a request limit. This is also a future improvement to use Twitter api to collect better complete data but this would require some budget.
